# Dining_Philosopher_Problem
Dining Philosopher Problem implemented though concept of semaphores in operating systems in c


Design and implement a solution for the dining philosopherâ€™s problem using semaphores.
In this problem, a group of philosophers sit at a round table and alternate between thinking and eating. However, there are only a limited number of chopsticks available for the philosophers to use as utensils. To eat, a philosopher must pick up both chopsticks adjacent to them. If a philosopher cannot pick up both chopsticks, they must wait until both are available. Use semaphores to ensure that each philosopher is able to eat without creating a deadlock or starvation scenario.
